## Scope

This policy covers the `khanij` crate and its published API. Vulnerabilities in
upstream dependencies should be reported to the respective maintainers; we will
track and update our dependency pins as fixes become available.

Security concerns for this crate primarily involve:

- **Denial of service**: Inputs that cause excessive computation or memory usage
- **Numerical overflow**: Calculations that produce incorrect results silently
- **Dependency vulnerabilities**: Issues in upstream crates

We run `cargo audit` and `cargo deny` in CI to catch known dependency
vulnerabilities.

## Disclosure

We follow coordinated disclosure. Reporters will be credited in the release
notes unless they prefer to remain anonymous.
